            <aside><p>U.S. Route 66 would run 2,448 mi upon it's completion!</p></aside>
            <p>Joplin was incorporated in 1873 when large desposits of lead and zinc were found in the area. After this, it would become one of the largest exporters of these minerals
                in the world. Train routes were brought through Joplin in order to haul out ore, and it quickly became a regional hub for southwest Missouri and the surrounding state districts. Route 66 was also 
                routed through Joplin's main street due to its central location.
                It remains a regional hub to this day, with several large logistic and transportation companies headquartering in Joplin, including CFI. 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression,
                saw the famous killer couple Bonnie and Clyde make a stop and hideout in a garage apartment in Joplin. A tipoff from a neighbor caused them to be chased out by law enforcement, leaving behind
                most of their posessions and eventually causing the building to be declared a historic site. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Joplin's mining efforts were a central part of war-time production of machinery and ammunitions. However, after World War 2, the mines were closed down and Joplin's growth levelled off. Today,
                the city's population remains around 50,000. Joplin's official website states an estimate for the population of the entire metropolitan regional area as over 175,000. This region covers many outlying
                rural towns and small cities in the Southwest section of Missouri, as well as some areas of Southeast Kansas. For many, Joplin is the closest metropolitan area by far.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to its historic Route 66 and mining roots, Joplin hosts a handful of trails and caves. The most notable nature area is the Wildcat Glades, just outside of Joplin.
                This area has several paved and natural trails, multiple access points to Shoal Creek, and the fastest continuous waterfall in the whole state of Misssouri, the Grand Falls. One of these
                trails even follows the edge of some bluffs overlooking the creek.
