            <p>Branson boasts an amazing number of attractions of all sorts, most notable of which is the old-fashioned, frontier-town styled theme park, Silver Dollar City. This park
                is decorated and stylized to create an immersive "old-timey" feel. Workers even dress the part, some playing acting roles in skits and plays depicting feuds from the original time period.
                The park hosts a number of master craftsmen. From leather-working to blacksmithing to woodcarving and more, you can watch them work and learn about the challenges and skills of their trade first hand.
                In addition, the park hosts a great number of original rides, including the record-holding Outlaw run, the fastest wooden coaster ever built!

            <p>Aside from the theme park, Branson offers a multitude of other attractions, including zip-lining through the forests of the Ozark Mountains, artificial ski slopes, water parks, and shopping centers.
                The Branson Landing is an outdoor shopping center featuring stores such as Belk and Bass Pro as well as a beautiful boardwalk across the Lake Taneycomo waterfront from a cliff-face. Many concerts and other events
                are hosted at the landing during the summer and fair weather months. Additionally, the city is home to many unique attractions, such as Dolly Parton's Stampede, the Mount Pleast Winery,
                and the Hollywood Was Museum.
            </p>
            <p>The city's location in the heart of the mountains means it isn't without is natural wonders. Marvel Cave (previously known as "Marble Cave") has been hosting tours for nearly 100 years. 
                Silver Dollar City even has it's own guided cave tours featuring a locally preserved bat population, underground waterways, and a candle-light tour, where the lights are turned off and guests used a 
                small electric candle to follow thier guide, showcasing the challenges faced by early mining ventures. Alongside Lake Taneycomo,  Branson hosts a multitude of natural parks and trails to tour.
