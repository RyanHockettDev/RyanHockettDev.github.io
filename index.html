                <p>Missouri is home to the Ozarks, a sprawling region of forests and mountains. This makes it a popular destination for nature-based travel. In addition, Missouri is
                home to many historical mining towns, as well as landmark features and attractions such as the St. Louis Gateway Arch, Silver Dollar City, and more than 90 state parks.</p>
                <p>The Show Me State is the birthplace of many historical figures such as authors Samuel Clemens (more widely know as Mark Twain) and T.S. Eliot, inventor George Washington Carver,
                    and former president Harry S. Truman. Missouri has also been a part of many signifcant historical moments in the United States. In 1803, the Louisana Purchase brought the land into
                posession of the U.S. In 1821, Missouri officially became the 24th state. In 1857 Dred Scott, an enslaved man, filed a lawsuit in Missouri for his freedom. The court ruled against him, fueling
            the approaching Civil War in 1861. The state would go on to become the leading exporter of mined lead, creating a significant contribution to the ammunitions and craft efforts
            of World War I and II. During this latter war era, many Missouri businesses shifted paradigms to contribute to the success of the war effort. Joplin was a town that prospered due to
    the     discovery of a large amount of iron and lead, and it's prominent train line location.</p>

            <h1><span class="bolded">C</span>ITY AND STATE DATA</h1>
            <p>According to the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center, Missouri sits at the 6th lowest cost-of-living state (as of an index determined in 2023), has an unemployment rate lower than the national
                average, and holds an average earned wage of around 60,000 dollars per year. This makes the state an easy place to move to, specifically in smaller counties where wage rates
                are higher in comparison to a slightly lower average cost of living. Larger counties such as St. Louis and Kansas City do have a higher average cost of living compared to the
                average earned wage, but this is to be expected in such densely populated areas.
            </p>
            <p>Many of the cities in Missouri are noteworthy, but this site focuses on three:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The capitol, Jefferson City</li>
                    <li>Joplin, a town popularized by mining deposits and its location along the iconic
                        and historic Route 66</li>
                    <li>Branson, a city known for its attractions that resides in the heart of the Ozarks.</li>
                </ol>
            <p>
