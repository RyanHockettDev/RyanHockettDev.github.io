            <p>The domed capitol building dominates the landscape of the city, sitting on a bluff overlooking the Missouri River. This bluff was the same location visited
                by Lewis and Clarke on their expedition across the new territory while following the river.
            </p>
            <p>Missouri's first capital city was actually St. Louis until 1821, when a legislature comittee voted to move to Lohman's Landing, a small trading port along the 
                Missouri River. Before the capitol building was constructed, St. Charles acted as the capital. In 1825, the trading post was incorporated into a city and was named
                Jefferson after the third U.S. president, Thomas Jefferson. A year later, Missouri legislature first began to meet at the capitol building, and has been doing so for nearly 200 years.

            <p>The city's most notable history occurs during the civil war. Missouri sat between the Union and Confederacy, and thus had many great divisions amongst its people. Jefferson City's
                official website details the vote that would decide Missouri's position: to stay in the Union. The acting governor, Claiborne Jackson was in favor of retaining slavery and thus took 
                50,000 volunteers in the state militia to march south and meet Confederate forces. However, Union troops quickly moved in and seized control of the capital. There was an attempt by former
                governor Sterling Price to retake the city, but he failed and withdrew westward towards Kansas City.
            </p>
            <p>The people of Jefferson City took many years to recover from this division, but by 1875 the city saw growth in industries such as print and shoe manufacturing. Within 10 years
                the gap between the pro-south Jefferson City and pro-north Kansas cities had been closed by the construction of the now prominent bridge across the Missouri River.
